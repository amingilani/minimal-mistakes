Among the many events of yesterday, Anonymous, a loose group of international activists declared a fullblown war upon the Government of Pakistan, and especially Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with a direct threat to the "safety and security of [his] family," anonymous urges Nawaz Sharif to leave Pakistan immediately.

Albeit extremely basic, their website has a care package to help protestors counter **tear gas** and internet censorship, among other things. I have personally verified that Operation Pakistan is linked to Operation Ferguson <del>because the OpPakistan website is an iframe pointing to the OpFerguson host</del> just trust me.

I'll keep adding updates to this list. Latest first:

+ Leaked: Transparency International Pakistan credentials
+ Leaked: Customer database for Center for International Strategic Studies
+ Even more websites
+ More websites knocked offline
+ Leaked:  23K Bank Records Of The Pakistan Government
+ Leaked:  Federal Public Service Commission usernames, emails, and passwords
+ Multiple websites knocked offline
+ OpPakistan Engaged

>Anonymous has watched in horror with the world as non-violent protesters from Palestine to Ferguson have been gassed,
>beaten, shot at and arrested this summer. And we have done everything in our power to intervene and protect them, and
>collect the evidence of the human rights violations perpetrated against them. But when protesters are killed; gunned down in
>the streets, and shelled with military grade mortars - Anonymous will, as it has in the past - remove that government from
>power.
>
>We are cataloging the atrocities being committed in Pakistan. We will begin at once assisting the peaceful protesters in
>Pakistan with every tool and tactic at our disposal. And we will initiate the process of removing every vestige of the
>Pakistan government from the Internet and shutting down their communications network. And the Pakistani people will then
>remove this criminal regime from power and lock them in prison where they belong. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you are hereby
>dismissed. You will leave power immediately. For the safety and security of your family we suggest that you depart Pakistan
>at once. This is your only warning.
>
>As for the criminal security and military forces who have so barbarically attacked your own people in Pakistan, we will
>collect evidence of your crimes and deal with you in the time and manner of our choosing. You would do well to....well, you
>know - expect us. You will either answer to the justice of your people and the international community, or you will be the
>subject of the rage filled vengeance of Anonymous.

>We Are Anonymous - We Are Everywhere - We Are Legion - We Do Not Forgive - We Do Not Forget...
