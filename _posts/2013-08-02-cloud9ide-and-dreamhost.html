<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Since I like to grab whatever computer I can find closest to me, the idea of my work being in the cloud obviously sounds very appealing. Yesterday I decided to make the ultimate jump and move my development environment to the cloud too. Enter <a href="https://c9.io/" target="_blank">Cloud9 IDE</a>. It really is like Google Docs for code. Read up on it yourself, but here's how i got my shared Dreamhost account to play nice.<!--more--></p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>I warn you, i think using node.js to actually build production applications is a violation of Dreamhost TOS, but hopefully they'll turn a blind-eye to this for our purposes. Still, i take no responsibility for what happens next.<br />
First get node.js:</p>
<pre><p>cd ~ #go to your home directory<br />
mkdir usr/local/bin #make a local bin<br />
mkdir tmp #make a new directory called tmp<br />
cd tmp #cd into tmp<br />
git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git #clone node.js<br />
cd node #cd into node<br />
git checkout v0.10.15 # v0.10.xx being required at the time i write this<br />
./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr/local #configure it for your local directory<br />
# ... random configuration text ...<br />
make #make it<br />
# ... random compile text ...<br />
make install #make install it<br />
# ... more random text ...<br />
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/[YOURUSERNAME]/usr/local/bin' &gt;&gt; .bashrc #replace [YOURUSERNAME] with your user<br />
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/[YOURUSERNAME]/usr/local/bin' &gt;&gt; .bash_profile #replace [YOURUSERNAME] with your user<br />
#now logout and log back in</p></pre>
<p>Now start creating a new workspace on Cloud9 IDE and select <em>SSH</em> for Hosting.Â Copy the rsa key and run the following command on your Dreamhost server:</p>
<pre><p>echo 'PASTE RSA KEY HERE' &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</p></pre>
<p>Now fill out the host and username, test connection and because it says successful, go do your thing.</p>
